    Distributed Ledger is an owner-less database consists of transactions between network participants. That data can be easily interpreted as a large graph of interactions between entities that contains a lot of node structural information and metadata. Which makes it a good target of applying Machine Learning algorithms, particularly clustering. 
    In this paper we consider node2vec - modern method of embedding of graph node's structural information into low-dimensional vector space. We conduct a comparative study of \textit{pure graph based clustering algorithms} with \textit{node2vec + K-means conjunction} and show that \textit{the latter} is superior not only in terms of accuracy of extracting clusters from SBM Random Graph but also in terms of scalability. Finally, node2vec embeddings for a subset of Ethereum Transactions data were generated. Visual representation of low-dimension vectors is given and clustering performed.
